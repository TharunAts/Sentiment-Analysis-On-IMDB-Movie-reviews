I have created a model which classifies Movie reviews into either positive or negative based on context.This model have achieved an accuracy of 78% on test data(around 17k samples).It includes several steps such as building a tokenizer,padding sequences,embedding layer, etc.The code can be recreated on jupyter notebook.
